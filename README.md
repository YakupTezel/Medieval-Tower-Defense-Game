#  Medieval Tower Defense (Unity, C#)

**Medieval Tower Defense** is a Unity-based tower defense game developed as a solo graduation project to strengthen hands-on experience with Unity, C# scripting, and core game development workflows.

The project focuses on building **scalable and configurable gameplay systems** rather than purely visual features. Most mechanics and parameters are exposed through the **Unity Inspector**, allowing rapid balancing and iteration without code changes.
